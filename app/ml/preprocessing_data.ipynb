         "Given a graph $G$, the family of all independent sets of size $k$ containing a fixed vertex $v$ is called a star with centre $v$, and is denoted by $\\mathcal{I}_G^k(v)$. Motivated by a generalisation of the Erdős-Ko-Rado Theorem to the setting of independent sets in graphs, Hurlbert and Kamat conjectured that for every tree $T$ and every $k$, the maximum of $|\\mathcal{I}_T^k(v)|$ can always be attained by a leaf of $T$. While this conjecture turns out to be false in general, it is known to hold for specific families of trees like spiders and caterpillars. In this paper, we prove that this conjecture holds for a new family of trees, the perfect $r$-ary trees, by constructing injections from stars centred at arbitrary vertices to stars centred at leaves. We also show that the analogous property holds for every forest $\\mathcal{T}$ that is the disjoint union of perfect trees with possibly varying sizes and arities, and determine the leaf that maximises $|\\mathcal{I}_{\\mathcal{T}}^k(v)|$.",

         "Wen Luo, Peng Chen, Xiaotao Huang, LiQun Huang",
         "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) incur high computational costs due to significant redundancy in their visual tokens. To effectively reduce this cost, researchers have proposed various visual token pruning methods. However, existing methods are generally limited, either losing critical visual information prematurely due to pruning in the vision encoder, or leading to information redundancy among the selected tokens due to pruning in the Large Language Models (LLMs). To address these challenges, we propose a Visual and Textual Semantic Collaborative Pruning framework (ViTCoP) that combines redundancy filtering in the vision encoder with step-wise co-pruning within the LLM based on its hierarchical characteristics, to efficiently preserve critical and informationally diverse visual tokens. Meanwhile, to ensure compatibility with acceleration techniques like FlashAttention, we introduce the L2 norm of K-vectors as the token saliency metric in the LLM. Extensive experiments on various Large Vision-Language Models demonstrate that ViTCoP not only achieves state-of-the-art performance surpassing existing methods on both image and video understanding tasks, but also significantly reduces model inference latency and GPU memory consumption. Notably, its performance advantage over other methods becomes even more pronounced under extreme pruning rates.",

         "We consider multicriteria problems of evaluating absolute ratings (scores, priorities, weights) of given alternatives for making decisions, which are compared in pairs under several criteria. Given matrices of pairwise comparisons of alternatives for each criterion and a matrix of pairwise comparisons of the criteria, the aim is to calculate a vector of individual ratings of alternatives. We formulate the problem as the Chebyshev approximation of matrices on the logarithmic scale by a common consistent matrix (a symmetrically reciprocal matrix of unit rank). We rearrange the approximation problem as a multi-objective optimization problem of finding a vector that determines the consistent matrix and hence yields a vector of ratings in question. The problem is then transformed into a series of optimization problems in the framework of tropical algebra, which focuses on the theory and application of algebraic systems with idempotent operations. To solve the optimization problems, we apply methods and results of tropical optimization, which yield analytical solutions in a form ready for further analysis and straightforward computation. To illustrate the technique implemented, we give a numerical example of solving a known problem, and compare the obtained solution with results provided by classical methods of analytic hierarchy process and weighted geometrical means.",

By employing martingale convergence techniques rather than ergodic-theoretic arguments, we demonstrate that this result holds without topological assumptions on $G$ (such as local compactness) and extends to general Markov chains. Furthermore, utilizing hitting models for the Poisson boundary, we characterise the inclusion $H^\\infty(G, \\mu) \\subseteq H^\\infty(G, \\theta)$ as equivalent to the asymptotic invariance of $\\theta$ under $\\mu$ in the weak* topology.

         "Large-scale video streaming events attract millions of simultaneous viewers, stressing existing delivery infrastructures. Client-driven adaptation reacts slowly to shared congestion, while server-based coordination introduces scalability bottlenecks and single points of failure. We present COMETS, a coordinated multi-destination video transmission framework that leverages information-centric networking principles such as request aggregation and in-network state awareness to enable scalable, fair, and adaptive rate control. COMETS introduces a novel range-interest protocol and distributed in-network decision process that aligns video quality across receiver groups while minimizing redundant transmissions. To achieve this, we develop a lightweight distributed optimization framework that guides per-hop quality adaptation without centralized control. Extensive emulation shows that COMETS consistently improves bandwidth utilization, fairness, and user-perceived quality of experience over DASH, MoQ, and ICN baselines, particularly under high concurrency. The results highlight COMETS as a practical, deployable approach for next-generation scalable video delivery.",

First, we curate a high-quality dataset consisting of 180 non-rigid motion videos from six physics-based categories, equipped with 2,340 fine-grained task instructions and 360 multiple-choice questions. Second, we propose NRVE-Acc, a novel evaluation metric based on Vision-Language Models that can rigorously assess physical compliance, temporal consistency, and instruction alignment, overcoming the limitations of general metrics in capturing complex dynamics. Third, we introduce a training-free baseline, VM-Edit, which utilizes a dual-region denoising mechanism to achieve structure-aware control, balancing structural preservation and dynamic deformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that while current methods have shortcomings in maintaining physical plausibility, our method achieves excellent performance across both standard and proposed metrics.

Modern day VLMs have made tremendous progress in image understanding but they struggle when it comes to understanding technical diagrams. One way to overcome this problem is to fine-tune on real world hand-drawn images, but it is not practically possible to generate large number of such images. In this paper, we introduce a large synthetically generated corpus (reflective of real world images) for training VLMs and subsequently evaluate VLMs on a smaller corpus of hand-drawn images (with the help of humans). We introduce several new self-supervision tasks for training and perform extensive experiments with various baseline models and fine-tune Llama 3.2 11B-instruct model on synthetic images on these tasks to obtain LLama-VL-TUG, which significantly improves the ROUGE-L performance of Llama 3.2 11B-instruct by 2.14x and achieves the best all-round performance across all baseline models. On real-world images, human evaluation reveals that we achieve minimum compilation errors across all baselines in 7 out of 8 diagram types and improve the average F1 score of Llama 3.2 11B-instruct by 6.97x.",

We identify the Fourier symbol of the DtN operator and show it coincides with that of the fractional Laplacian, which yields an explicit Fourier-multiplier representation and allows construction of the corresponding fundamental solution. Using this representation we express the surface velocity as a convolution of the fundamental solution with the interfacial curvature forcing and analyze its normal limit to derive a boundary integral equation for the moving curve. Independently, exploiting the DtN representation we establish a curve-shortening identity: the interfacial perimeter decreases monotonically and its time derivative is controlled by $\\dot{H}^{1/2}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$-norm of the surface velocity. Building on the boundary integral equation, we prove local well-posedness via maximal $L^2$-regularity for quasilinear parabolic systems, employing a DeTurck-type reparametrization, and show equivalence with the original ILLSS system.

         "Partial differential equation (PDE) models for infectious diseases, while less common than their ordinary differential equation (ODE) counterparts, have found successful applications for many years. Such models are typically of reaction-diffusion type, and model spatial propagation as a diffusive process. However, given the complex nature of human mobility, such models are limited in their ability to describe airborne infectious diseases in human populations. Recent work has advocated for the inclusion of an additional chemotaxis-type term as an alternative; spatial propagation of infection fronts is assumed additionally to flow from low-to-high concentrations of susceptible populations. The present work extends the study of such models by providing an epidemiologically interpretable analysis, directly connecting model behavior to information readily available to policymakers. In particular, we derive a spatially-aware basic reproduction number, which accounts for spatial heterogeneity in population density. Furthermore, we discuss several important aspects concerning the numerical solution of the model, including the introduction of a stabilization scheme. Finally, we perform a series of simulation studies in the Italian region of Lombardy (severely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020) and in the US state of Georgia, in which we demonstrate the model's potential to better capture important spatiotemporal dynamics observed in real-world data compared to pure reaction-diffusion models.",

         "Jiayi Zhou, Liwenhan Xie, Jiaju Ma, Zheng Wei, Huamin Qu, Anyi Rao",
         "Digital collage is an artistic practice that combines image cutouts to tell stories. However, preparing cutouts from a set of photos remains a tedious and time-consuming task. A formative study identified three main challenges: 1) inefficient search for relevant photos, 2) manual image cutout, and 3) difficulty in organizing large sets of cutouts. To meet these challenges and facilitate asset preparation for collage, we propose Collaposer, a tool that transforms a collection of photos into organized, ready-to-use visual cutouts based on user-provided story descriptions. Collaposer tags, detects, and segments photos, and then uses an LLM to select central and related labels based on the user-provided story description. Collaposer presents the resulting visuals in varying sizes, clustered according to semantic hierarchy. Our evaluation shows that Collaposer effectively automates the preparation process to produce diverse sets of visual cutouts adhering to the storyline, allowing users to focus on collaging these assets for storytelling.\nProject website: this https URL",

         "Chenyu Zhang, Xinchen Lyu, Chenshan Ren, Shuhan Liu, Qimei Cui, Xiaofeng Tao",
         "Wireless foundation models promise transformative capabilities for channel state information (CSI) processing across diverse 6G network applications, yet face fundamental challenges due to the inherent dual heterogeneity of CSI across both scale and scenario dimensions. However, current pretraining approaches either constrain inputs to fixed dimensions or isolate training by scale, limiting the generalization and scalability of wireless foundation models. In this paper, we propose HeterCSI, a channel-adaptive pretraining framework that reconciles training efficiency with robust cross-scenario generalization via a new understanding of gradient dynamics in heterogeneous CSI pretraining. Our key insight reveals that CSI scale heterogeneity primarily causes destructive gradient interference, while scenario diversity actually promotes constructive gradient alignment when properly managed. Specifically, we formulate heterogeneous CSI batch construction as a partitioning optimization problem that minimizes zero-padding overhead while preserving scenario diversity. To solve this, we develop a scale-aware adaptive batching strategy that aligns CSI samples of similar scales, and design a double-masking mechanism to isolate valid signals from padding artifacts. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate that HeterCSI establishes a generalized foundation model without scenario-specific finetuning, achieving superior average performance over full-shot baselines. Compared to the state-of-the-art zero-shot benchmark WiFo, it reduces NMSE by 7.19 dB, 4.08 dB, and 5.27 dB for CSI reconstruction, time-domain, and frequency-domain prediction, respectively. The proposed HeterCSI framework also reduces training latency by 53% compared to existing approaches while improving generalization performance by 1.53 dB on average.",

To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes \\textbf{\\namex}, a lightweight intrinsic guidance framework for efficient diffusion training. \\name leverages off-the-shelf pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) features: their reconstruction property ensures inherent encoding of visual priors like rich texture details, structural patterns, and basic semantic information. Specifically, \\name aligns the intermediate latent features of diffusion transformers with VAE features via a lightweight projection layer, supervised by a feature alignment loss. This design accelerates training without extra representation encoders or dual-model maintenance, resulting in a simple yet effective pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \\name improves both generation quality and training convergence speed compared to vanilla diffusion transformers, matches or outperforms state-of-the-art acceleration methods, and incurs merely 4\\% extra GFLOPs with zero additional cost for external guidance models.",

         "Accurate evaluation of user satisfaction is critical for iterative development of conversational AI. However, for open-ended assistants, traditional A/B testing lacks reliable metrics: explicit feedback is sparse, while implicit metrics are ambiguous. To bridge this gap, we introduce BoRP (Bootstrapped Regression Probing), a scalable framework for high-fidelity satisfaction evaluation. Unlike generative approaches, BoRP leverages the geometric properties of LLM latent space. It employs a polarization-index-based bootstrapping mechanism to automate rubric generation and utilizes Partial Least Squares (PLS) to map hidden states to continuous scores. Experiments on industrial datasets show that BoRP (Qwen3-8B/14B) significantly outperforms generative baselines (even Qwen3-Max) in alignment with human judgments. Furthermore, BoRP reduces inference costs by orders of magnitude, enabling full-scale monitoring and highly sensitive A/B testing via CUPED.",

Attempts were made by Mow over 30 years ago, but a comprehensive understanding to this problem is lacking. Our first key contribution is an explicit upper bound of generalized quadratic Gauss sums which is obtained by recursively applying Paris' asymptotic expansion and then bounding it by leveraging the fast convergence property of the Fibonacci zeta function. Building upon this major finding, our second key contribution includes four systematic constructions of order-optimal sequence sets with low aperiodic correlation and/or ambiguity properties via carefully selected Chu sequences and Alltop sequences. For the first time in the literature, we reveal that the full Alltop sequence set is asymptotically optimal for its low aperiodic correlation sidelobes. Besides, we introduce a novel subset of Alltop sequences possessing both order-optimal aperiodic correlation and ambiguity properties for the entire time-shift window.",

They leverage in-context learning to offer high predictive accuracy in real-world tasks. However, the fairness properties of these foundational models, which incorporate ideas from causal reasoning during pre-training, have not yet been explored in sufficient depth. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of TabPFN and its fine-tuned variants, assessing predictive performance, fairness, and robustness across varying dataset sizes and distributional shifts. Our results reveal that while TabPFN achieves stronger predictive accuracy compared to baselines and exhibits robustness to spurious correlations, improvements in fairness are moderate and inconsistent, particularly under missing-not-at-random (MNAR) covariate shifts. These findings suggest that the causal pre-training in TabPFN is helpful but insufficient for algorithmic fairness, highlighting implications for deploying such models in practice and the need for further fairness interventions.",

         "The grade of membership model is a flexible latent variable model for analyzing multivariate categorical data through individual-level mixed membership scores. In many modern applications, auxiliary covariates are collected alongside responses and encode information about the same latent structure. Traditional approaches to incorporating such covariates typically rely on fully specified joint likelihoods, which are computationally intensive and sensitive to misspecification. We introduce a covariate-assisted grade of membership model that integrates response and covariate information by exploiting their shared low-rank simplex geometry, rather than modeling their joint distribution. We propose a likelihood-free spectral estimation procedure that combines heterogeneous data sources through a balance parameter controlling their relative contribution. To accommodate high-dimensional and heteroskedastic noise, we employ heteroskedastic principal component analysis before performing simplex-based geometric recovery. Our theoretical analysis establishes weaker identifiability conditions than those required in the covariate-free model, and further derives finite-sample, entrywise error bounds for both mixed membership scores and item parameters. These results demonstrate that auxiliary covariates can provably improve latent structure recovery, yielding faster convergence rates in high-dimensional regimes. Simulation studies and an application to educational assessment data illustrate the computational efficiency, statistical accuracy, and interpretability gains of the proposed method.

         "Separating liquid-liquid dispersions in gravity settlers is critical in chemical, pharmaceutical, and recycling processes. The dense-packed zone height is an important performance and safety indicator but it is often expensive and impractical to measure due to optical limitations. We propose to estimate phase heights using only inexpensive volume flow measurements. To this end, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) is first pretrained on synthetic data and physics equations derived from a low-fidelity (approximate) mechanistic model to reduce the need for extensive experimental data. While the mechanistic model is used to generate synthetic training data, only volume balance equations are used in the PINN, since the integration of submodels describing droplet coalescence and sedimentation into the PINN would be computationally prohibitive. The pretrained PINN is then fine-tuned with scarce experimental data to capture the actual dynamics of the separator. We then employ the differentiable PINN as a predictive model in an Extended Kalman Filter inspired state estimation framework, enabling the phase heights to be tracked and updated from flow-rate measurements. We first test the two-stage trained PINN by forward simulation from a known initial state against the mechanistic model and a non-pretrained PINN. We then evaluate phase height estimation performance with the filter, comparing the two-stage trained PINN with a two-stage trained purely data-driven neural network. All model types are trained and evaluated using ensembles to account for model parameter uncertainty. In all evaluations, the two-stage trained PINN yields the most accurate phase-height estimates.",

To tackle this problem, we develop a unified framework for reward function recovery in two-player zero-sum matrix games and Markov games with entropy regularization, where we aim to reconstruct the underlying reward functions given observed players' strategies and actions. This task is challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of inverse problems, the non-uniqueness of feasible rewards, and limited observational data coverage. To address these challenges, we establish the reward function's identifiability using the quantal response equilibrium (QRE) under linear assumptions. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we propose a novel algorithm to learn reward functions from observed actions. Our algorithm works in both static and dynamic settings and is adaptable to incorporate different methods, such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). We provide strong theoretical guarantees for the reliability and sample efficiency of our algorithm. Further, we conduct extensive numerical studies to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed framework, offering new insights into decision-making in competitive environments.",

These latent positions constitute the primary objects of inference, which is conducted via spectral embedding methods.

         "Understanding how ancient Mesoamerican societies integrated mathematical ideas into calendrical design and monumental architecture requires approaches that acknowledge their distinct epistemological frameworks. While explicit textual evidence for concepts such as $\\pi$ or the golden ratio $\\phi$ is absent, numerical patterns embedded in Mesoamerican calendars, iconography, and ritual architecture reveal a coherent system of proportional reasoning grounded in simple integer ratios. Here we show that the numbers 5 and 8, central to Venus and solar calendrical relations and widely represented in Mesoamerican cosmology, generate rational approximations that reproduce, within known construction tolerances, the geometric relations associated with decagonal layouts. Using high-resolution measurements of the Iguana structure at Guachimontones, we demonstrate that its proportions align with integer ratios consistent with those found in the calendrical system and with the practical geometry of the regular decagon, without requiring knowledge of irrational constants. These findings suggest that Mesoamerican builders employed stable proportional modules that harmonized astronomical cycles, cosmological symbolism, and architectural design. This should not be interpreted as a lack of mathematical sophistication; rather, the material record reveals a distinct mathematical tradition in which number, measure, and cosmology were mutually reinforcing elements of cultural knowledge.",

         "AI-assisted writing raises concerns about autonomy and ownership when benefiting writers. Personalization has been proposed as an effective solution while also risking writers' reliance on AI and behavior shifting. For better personalization design, existing studies rely on interaction and information solely within the writing phase; however, few studies have examined how reading behaviors can inform personalized writing. This study investigates the effects of integrating reading highlights for personalization on AI-assisted writing. A between-subjects study with 46 participants revealed that the personalization condition encouraged participants to produce more highlights. However, highlighting unexpectedly shifted from a sense-making strategy to an instrumental act of \"feeding the AI,\" leading to significant reliance on AI and declines in writers' sense of autonomy, ownership, and self-credit. These findings indicate personalization risks in AI-assisted writing, emphasize the importance of personalization strategies, and provide design implications.",

Most of the previously known and even tight characterizations of contraction of information measures, including total variation distance, hockey-stick divergences, and $f$-divergences, are applicable for $(\\varepsilon,0)$-local differential private (LDP) mechanisms. In this work, we derive both linear and non-linear strong data-processing inequalities for hockey-stick divergence and $f$-divergences that are valid for all $(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-LDP mechanisms even when $\\delta \\neq 0$.

         "Global inequality has shifted inward, with rising dispersion increasingly occurring within countries rather than between them. Using 8,790 newly harmonised Functional Urban Areas (FUAs), micro-founded labour-market regions encompassing 3.9 billion people and representing approximately 80% of global GDP, we show that national aggregates systematically, and increasingly, misrepresent the dynamics of growth, convergence, and structural change. Drawing on high-resolution global GDP data and country-level capability measures, we find that the middle-income trampoline that previously drove global convergence is flattening. This divergence in the lower-income regime does not reflect poverty traps: low-income FUAs exhibit positive expected growth, and the transition curve displays no stable low-income equilibrium. Instead, productive capabilities, proxied by the Economic Complexity Index, define distinct growth regimes. FUAs converge within capability strata but diverge across them, and capability upgrading follows a predictable J-curve marked by short-run disruption and medium-run acceleration. These findings suggest that national convergence policies may be systematically misaligned with the geographic scale at which capability accumulation operates.",

         "Or Ordentlich, Yury Polyanskiy",
         "This work investigates the problem of quantized matrix multiplication (MatMul), which has become crucial for the efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs). We consider two settings: 1) Generic MatMul, where both matrices must be quantized (weight+activation quantization); and 2) weight-only quantization, where the second matrix is only known through covariance matrix $\\Sigma_X$ of its columns. For each setting, we first review the fundamental information-theoretic tradeoff between quantization rate and distortion (high-rate theory), and then analyze the performance of several popular quantization schemes, comparing them to these fundamental limits. Specifically, we discuss rate loss (compared to information theoretic optima) of absmax INT and floating-point (FP) quantization, for which we also derive remarkably accurate heuristic approximations. Weight-only quantization is related to the problem of weighted mean squared error (WMSE) source coding, whose classical (reverse) waterfilling solution dictates how one should distribute rate between coordinates of the vector. We show how waterfilling can be used to improve practical LLM quantization algorithms (GPTQ), which at present allocate rate equally. This new scheme (termed ``WaterSIC'') only uses scalar INT quantizers, but its high-rate performance is basis free (it depends only on the determinant of $\\Sigma_X$ and, thus, unlike existing schemes, is immune to applying random rotations) and is within a multiplicative factor of $\\frac{2\\pi e}{12}$ (or 0.25 bit/entry) of the information-theoretic distortion limit (!). GPTQ's performance is affected by the choice of basis, but for a random rotation and actual $\\Sigma_X$ from Llama-3-8B we find GPTQ to be within 0.1 bit (depending on the layer type) of WaterSIC, suggesting that GPTQ with random rotation is also near optimal (for high-rate quantization).",

We propose a new stopping criterion for efficient termination and preventing long runs of sampling in the stationary post-convergence phase of the algorithm and discuss Monte Carlo sample size choice. We run a series of simulation comparisons of spatial statistical models alongside the popular integrated nested Laplacian approximation method and demonstrate potential for similar or improved estimator performance and reduced running times. We also consider scaling of the algorithms to large datasets and demonstrate a greater than 100-fold reduction in running times using modern GPU hardware to illustrate the feasibility of full maximum likelihood methods with big spatial datasets.",

Motivated by a generalisation of the Erdős-Ko-Rado Theorem to the setting of independent sets in graphs, Hurlbert and Kamat conjectured that for every tree $T$ and every $k$, the maximum of $|\\mathcal{I}_T^k(v)|$ can always be attained by a leaf of $T$. While this conjecture turns out to be false in general, it is known to hold for specific families of trees like spiders and caterpillars. In this paper, we prove that this conjecture holds for a new family of trees, the perfect $r$-ary trees, by constructing injections from stars centred at arbitrary vertices to stars centred at leaves. We also show that the analogous property holds for every forest $\\mathcal{T}$ that is the disjoint union of perfect trees with possibly varying sizes and arities, and determine the leaf that maximises $|\\mathcal{I}_{\\mathcal{T}}^k(v)|$."

         "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) incur high computational costs due to significant redundancy in their visual tokens. To effectively reduce this cost, researchers have proposed various visual token pruning methods. However, existing methods are generally limited, either losing critical visual information prematurely due to pruning in the vision encoder, or leading to information redundancy among the selected tokens due to pruning in the Large Language Models (LLMs). To address these challenges, we propose a Visual and Textual Semantic Collaborative Pruning framework (ViTCoP) that combines redundancy filtering in the vision encoder with step-wise co-pruning within the LLM based on its hierarchical characteristics, to efficiently preserve critical and informationally diverse visual tokens. Meanwhile, to ensure compatibility with acceleration techniques like FlashAttention, we introduce the L2 norm of K-vectors as the token saliency metric in the LLM. Extensive experiments on various Large Vision-Language Models demonstrate that ViTCoP not only achieves state-of-the-art performance surpassing existing methods on both image and video understanding tasks, but also significantly reduces model inference latency and GPU memory consumption. Notably, its performance advantage over other methods becomes even more pronounced under extreme pruning rates."

Given matrices of pairwise comparisons of alternatives for each criterion and a matrix of pairwise comparisons of the criteria, the aim is to calculate a vector of individual ratings of alternatives. We formulate the problem as the Chebyshev approximation of matrices on the logarithmic scale by a common consistent matrix (a symmetrically reciprocal matrix of unit rank). We rearrange the approximation problem as a multi-objective optimization problem of finding a vector that determines the consistent matrix and hence yields a vector of ratings in question. The problem is then transformed into a series of optimization problems in the framework of tropical algebra, which focuses on the theory and application of algebraic systems with idempotent operations. To solve the optimization problems, we apply methods and results of tropical optimization, which yield analytical solutions in a form ready for further analysis and straightforward computation. To illustrate the technique implemented, we give a numerical example of solving a known problem, and compare the obtained solution with results provided by classical methods of analytic hierarchy process and weighted geometrical means."

COMETS introduces a novel range-interest protocol and distributed in-network decision process that aligns video quality across receiver groups while minimizing redundant transmissions. To achieve this, we develop a lightweight distributed optimization framework that guides per-hop quality adaptation without centralized control. Extensive emulation shows that COMETS consistently improves bandwidth utilization, fairness, and user-perceived quality of experience over DASH, MoQ, and ICN baselines, particularly under high concurrency.

Modern day VLMs have made tremendous progress in image understanding but they struggle when it comes to understanding technical diagrams. One way to overcome this problem is to fine-tune on real world hand-drawn images, but it is not practically possible to generate large number of such images. In this paper, we introduce a large synthetically generated corpus (reflective of real world images) for training VLMs and subsequently evaluate VLMs on a smaller corpus of hand-drawn images (with the help of humans).

Eliminating the bulk variables, we reformulate the coupled three-dimensional system as an evolution on the film involving the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator. We identify the Fourier symbol of the DtN operator and show it coincides with that of the fractional Laplacian, which yields an explicit Fourier-multiplier representation and allows construction of the corresponding fundamental solution. Using this representation we express the surface velocity as a convolution of the fundamental solution with the interfacial curvature forcing and analyze its normal limit to derive a boundary integral equation for the moving curve. Independently, exploiting the DtN representation we establish a curve-shortening identity: the interfacial perimeter decreases monotonically and its time derivative is controlled by $\\dot{H}^{1/2}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$-norm of the surface velocity. Building on the boundary integral equation, we prove local well-posedness via maximal $L^2$-regularity for quasilinear parabolic systems, employing a DeTurck-type reparametrization, and show equivalence with the original ILLSS system.

Such models are typically of reaction-diffusion type, and model spatial propagation as a diffusive process. However, given the complex nature of human mobility, such models are limited in their ability to describe airborne infectious diseases in human populations. Recent work has advocated for the inclusion of an additional chemotaxis-type term as an alternative; spatial propagation of infection fronts is assumed additionally to flow from low-to-high concentrations of susceptible populations. The present work extends the study of such models by providing an epidemiologically interpretable analysis, directly connecting model behavior to information readily available to policymakers. In particular, we derive a spatially-aware basic reproduction number, which accounts for spatial heterogeneity in population density. Furthermore, we discuss several important aspects concerning the numerical solution of the model, including the introduction of a stabilization scheme. Finally, we perform a series of simulation studies in the Italian region of Lombardy (severely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020) and in the US state of Georgia, in which we demonstrate the model's potential to better capture important spatiotemporal dynamics observed in real-world data compared to pure reaction-diffusion models."

To meet these challenges and facilitate asset preparation for collage, we propose Collaposer, a tool that transforms a collection of photos into organized, ready-to-use visual cutouts based on user-provided story descriptions. Collaposer tags, detects, and segments photos, and then uses an LLM to select central and related labels based on the user-provided story description.

         "Wireless foundation models promise transformative capabilities for channel state information (CSI) processing across diverse 6G network applications, yet face fundamental challenges due to the inherent dual heterogeneity of CSI across both scale and scenario dimensions. However, current pretraining approaches either constrain inputs to fixed dimensions or isolate training by scale, limiting the generalization and scalability of wireless foundation models. In this paper, we propose HeterCSI, a channel-adaptive pretraining framework that reconciles training efficiency with robust cross-scenario generalization via a new understanding of gradient dynamics in heterogeneous CSI pretraining. Our key insight reveals that CSI scale heterogeneity primarily causes destructive gradient interference, while scenario diversity actually promotes constructive gradient alignment when properly managed. Specifically, we formulate heterogeneous CSI batch construction as a partitioning optimization problem that minimizes zero-padding overhead while preserving scenario diversity. To solve this, we develop a scale-aware adaptive batching strategy that aligns CSI samples of similar scales, and design a double-masking mechanism to isolate valid signals from padding artifacts. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate that HeterCSI establishes a generalized foundation model without scenario-specific finetuning, achieving superior average performance over full-shot baselines. Compared to the state-of-the-art zero-shot benchmark WiFo, it reduces NMSE by 7.19 dB, 4.08 dB, and 5.27 dB for CSI reconstruction, time-domain, and frequency-domain prediction, respectively. The proposed HeterCSI framework also reduces training latency by 53% compared to existing approaches while improving generalization performance by 1.53 dB on average."

In many modern applications, auxiliary covariates are collected alongside responses and encode information about the same latent structure. Traditional approaches to incorporating such covariates typically rely on fully specified joint likelihoods, which are computationally intensive and sensitive to misspecification. We introduce a covariate-assisted grade of membership model that integrates response and covariate information by exploiting their shared low-rank simplex geometry, rather than modeling their joint distribution. We propose a likelihood-free spectral estimation procedure that combines heterogeneous data sources through a balance parameter controlling their relative contribution. To accommodate high-dimensional and heteroskedastic noise, we employ heteroskedastic principal component analysis before performing simplex-based geometric recovery. Our theoretical analysis establishes weaker identifiability conditions than those required in the covariate-free model, and further derives finite-sample, entrywise error bounds for both mixed membership scores and item parameters. These results demonstrate that auxiliary covariates can provably improve latent structure recovery, yielding faster convergence rates in high-dimensional regimes.

         "Separating liquid-liquid dispersions in gravity settlers is critical in chemical, pharmaceutical, and recycling processes. The dense-packed zone height is an important performance and safety indicator but it is often expensive and impractical to measure due to optical limitations. We propose to estimate phase heights using only inexpensive volume flow measurements. To this end, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) is first pretrained on synthetic data and physics equations derived from a low-fidelity (approximate) mechanistic model to reduce the need for extensive experimental data. While the mechanistic model is used to generate synthetic training data, only volume balance equations are used in the PINN, since the integration of submodels describing droplet coalescence and sedimentation into the PINN would be computationally prohibitive. The pretrained PINN is then fine-tuned with scarce experimental data to capture the actual dynamics of the separator. We then employ the differentiable PINN as a predictive model in an Extended Kalman Filter inspired state estimation framework, enabling the phase heights to be tracked and updated from flow-rate measurements. We first test the two-stage trained PINN by forward simulation from a known initial state against the mechanistic model and a non-pretrained PINN. We then evaluate phase height estimation performance with the filter, comparing the two-stage trained PINN with a two-stage trained purely data-driven neural network. All model types are trained and evaluated using ensembles to account for model parameter uncertainty. In all evaluations, the two-stage trained PINN yields the most accurate phase-height estimates."

         "Estimating the unknown reward functions driving agents' behaviors is of central interest in inverse reinforcement learning and game theory. To tackle this problem, we develop a unified framework for reward function recovery in two-player zero-sum matrix games and Markov games with entropy regularization, where we aim to reconstruct the underlying reward functions given observed players' strategies and actions. This task is challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of inverse problems, the non-uniqueness of feasible rewards, and limited observational data coverage. To address these challenges, we establish the reward function's identifiability using the quantal response equilibrium (QRE) under linear assumptions. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we propose a novel algorithm to learn reward functions from observed actions. Our algorithm works in both static and dynamic settings and is adaptable to incorporate different methods, such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). We provide strong theoretical guarantees for the reliability and sample efficiency of our algorithm. Further, we conduct extensive numerical studies to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed framework, offering new insights into decision-making in competitive environments."

Heterogeneity in edge types further gives rise to multiplex network point processes. In this work, we propose a model for multiplex network data observed in continuous-time. We establish two-to-infinity norm consistency and asymptotic normality for spectral-embedding-based estimation of the model parameters as both network size and time resolution increase. Drawing inspiration from random dot product graph models, each edge intensity is expressed as the inner product of two low-dimensional latent positions: one dynamic and layer-agnostic, the other static and layer-dependent. These latent positions constitute the primary objects of inference, which is conducted via spectral embedding methods. Our theoretical results are established under a histogram estimator of the network intensities and provide justification for applying a doubly unfolded adjacency spectral embedding method for estimation. Simulations and real-data analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and inference procedure."

While explicit textual evidence for concepts such as $\\pi$ or the golden ratio $\\phi$ is absent, numerical patterns embedded in Mesoamerican calendars, iconography, and ritual architecture reveal a coherent system of proportional reasoning grounded in simple integer ratios.

Using high-resolution measurements of the Iguana structure at Guachimontones, we demonstrate that its proportions align with integer ratios consistent with those found in the calendrical system and with the practical geometry of the regular decagon, without requiring knowledge of irrational constants. These findings suggest that Mesoamerican builders employed stable proportional modules that harmonized astronomical cycles, cosmological symbolism, and architectural design.

Using 8,790 newly harmonised Functional Urban Areas (FUAs), micro-founded labour-market regions encompassing 3.9 billion people and representing approximately 80% of global GDP, we show that national aggregates systematically, and increasingly, misrepresent the dynamics of growth, convergence, and structural change. Drawing on high-resolution global GDP data and country-level capability measures, we find that the middle-income trampoline that previously drove global convergence is flattening. This divergence in the lower-income regime does not reflect poverty traps: low-income FUAs exhibit positive expected growth, and the transition curve displays no stable low-income equilibrium. Instead, productive capabilities, proxied by the Economic Complexity Index, define distinct growth regimes. FUAs converge within capability strata but diverge across them, and capability upgrading follows a predictable J-curve marked by short-run disruption and medium-run acceleration. These findings suggest that national convergence policies may be systematically misaligned with the geographic scale at which capability accumulation operates."

We consider two settings: 1) Generic MatMul, where both matrices must be quantized (weight+activation quantization); and 2) weight-only quantization, where the second matrix is only known through covariance matrix $\\Sigma_X$ of its columns. For each setting, we first review the fundamental information-theoretic tradeoff between quantization rate and distortion (high-rate theory), and then analyze the performance of several popular quantization schemes, comparing them to these fundamental limits. Specifically, we discuss rate loss (compared to information theoretic optima) of absmax INT and floating-point (FP) quantization, for which we also derive remarkably accurate heuristic approximations. Weight-only quantization is related to the problem of weighted mean squared error (WMSE) source coding, whose classical (reverse) waterfilling solution dictates how one should distribute rate between coordinates of the vector. We show how waterfilling can be used to improve practical LLM quantization algorithms (GPTQ), which at present allocate rate equally. This new scheme (termed ``WaterSIC'') only uses scalar INT quantizers, but its high-rate performance is basis free (it depends only on the determinant of $\\Sigma_X$ and, thus, unlike existing schemes, is immune to applying random rotations) and is within a multiplicative factor of $\\frac{2\\pi e}{12}$ (or 0.25 bit/entry) of the information-theoretic distortion limit (!). GPTQ's performance is affected by the choice of basis, but for a random rotation and actual $\\Sigma_X$ from Llama-3-8B we find GPTQ to be within 0.1 bit (depending on the layer type) of WaterSIC, suggesting that GPTQ with random rotation is also near optimal (for high-rate quantization)."

         "we consider multicriteria problems of evaluating absolute ratings (scores, priorities, weights) of given alternatives for making decisions, which are compared in pairs under several criteria. given matrices of pairwise comparisons of alternatives for each criterion and a matrix of pairwise comparisons of the criteria, the aim is to calculate a vector of individual ratings of alternatives. we formulate the problem as the chebyshev approximation of matrices on the logarithmic scale by a common consistent matrix (a symmetrically reciprocal matrix of unit rank). we rearrange the approximation problem as a multi-objective optimization problem of finding a vector that determines the consistent matrix and hence yields a vector of ratings in question. the problem is then transformed into a series of optimization problems in the framework of tropical algebra, which focuses on the theory and application of algebraic systems with idempotent operations. to solve the optimization problems, we apply methods and results of tropical optimization, which yield analytical solutions in a form ready for further analysis and straightforward computation. to illustrate the technique implemented, we give a numerical example of solving a known problem, and compare the obtained solution with results provided by classical methods of analytic hierarchy process and weighted geometrical means.",

         "this work is motivated by the long-standing open problem of designing asymptotically order-optimal aperiodic polyphase sequence sets with respect to the celebrated welch bound. attempts were made by mow over 30 years ago, but a comprehensive understanding to this problem is lacking. our first key contribution is an explicit upper bound of generalized quadratic gauss sums which is obtained by recursively applying paris' asymptotic expansion and then bounding it by leveraging the fast convergence property of the fibonacci zeta function. building upon this major finding, our second key contribution includes four systematic constructions of order-optimal sequence sets with low aperiodic correlation and/or ambiguity properties via carefully selected chu sequences and alltop sequences. for the first time in the literature, we reveal that the full alltop sequence set is asymptotically optimal for its low aperiodic correlation sidelobes. besides, we introduce a novel subset of alltop sequences possessing both order-optimal aperiodic correlation and ambiguity properties for the entire time-shift window.",

         "the grade of membership model is a flexible latent variable model for analyzing multivariate categorical data through individual-level mixed membership scores. in many modern applications, auxiliary covariates are collected alongside responses and encode information about the same latent structure. traditional approaches to incorporating such covariates typically rely on fully specified joint likelihoods, which are computationally intensive and sensitive to misspecification. we introduce a covariate-assisted grade of membership model that integrates response and covariate information by exploiting their shared low-rank simplex geometry, rather than modeling their joint distribution. we propose a likelihood-free spectral estimation procedure that combines heterogeneous data sources through a balance parameter controlling their relative contribution. to accommodate high-dimensional and heteroskedastic noise, we employ heteroskedastic principal component analysis before performing simplex-based geometric recovery. our theoretical analysis establishes weaker identifiability conditions than those required in the covariate-free model, and further derives finite-sample, entrywise error bounds for both mixed membership scores and item parameters. these results demonstrate that auxiliary covariates can provably improve latent structure recovery, yielding faster convergence rates in high-dimensional regimes. simulation studies and an application to educational assessment data illustrate the computational efficiency, statistical accuracy, and interpretability gains of the proposed method. the code for reproducing these results is open-source and available at \\texttt{this https url}",

         "this work investigates the problem of quantized matrix multiplication (matmul), which has become crucial for the efficient deployment of large language models (llms). we consider two settings: 1) generic matmul, where both matrices must be quantized (weight+activation quantization); and 2) weight-only quantization, where the second matrix is only known through covariance matrix $\\sigma_x$ of its columns. for each setting, we first review the fundamental information-theoretic tradeoff between quantization rate and distortion (high-rate theory), and then analyze the performance of several popular quantization schemes, comparing them to these fundamental limits. specifically, we discuss rate loss (compared to information theoretic optima) of absmax int and floating-point (fp) quantization, for which we also derive remarkably accurate heuristic approximations. weight-only quantization is related to the problem of weighted mean squared error (wmse) source coding, whose classical (reverse) waterfilling solution dictates how one should distribute rate between coordinates of the vector. we show how waterfilling can be used to improve practical llm quantization algorithms (gptq), which at present allocate rate equally. this new scheme (termed ``watersic'') only uses scalar int quantizers, but its high-rate performance is basis free (it depends only on the determinant of $\\sigma_x$ and, thus, unlike existing schemes, is immune to applying random rotations) and is within a multiplicative factor of $\\frac{2\\pi e}{12}$ (or 0.25 bit/entry) of the information-theoretic distortion limit (!). gptq's performance is affected by the choice of basis, but for a random rotation and actual $\\sigma_x$ from llama-3-8b we find gptq to be within 0.1 bit (depending on the layer type) of watersic, suggesting that gptq with random rotation is also near optimal (for high-rate quantization).",

         "estimation of generalised linear mixed models (glmm) including spatial gaussian process models is often considered computationally impractical for even moderately sized datasets. in this article, we propose a fast monte carlo maximum likelihood (mcml) algorithm for the estimation of glmms. the algorithm is a stochastic newton-raphson method, which approximates the expected hessian and gradient of the log-likelihood by drawing samples of the random effects. we propose a new stopping criterion for efficient termination and preventing long runs of sampling in the stationary post-convergence phase of the algorithm and discuss monte carlo sample size choice. we run a series of simulation comparisons of spatial statistical models alongside the popular integrated nested laplacian approximation method and demonstrate potential for similar or improved estimator performance and reduced running times. we also consider scaling of the algorithms to large datasets and demonstrate a greater than 100-fold reduction in running times using modern gpu hardware to illustrate the feasibility of full maximum likelihood methods with big spatial datasets.",

         "large visionlanguage models lvlms incur high computational costs due to significant redundancy in their visual tokens to effectively reduce this cost researchers have proposed various visual token pruning methods however existing methods are generally limited either losing critical visual information prematurely due to pruning in the vision encoder or leading to information redundancy among the selected tokens due to pruning in the large language models llms to address these challenges we propose a visual and textual semantic collaborative pruning framework vitcop that combines redundancy filtering in the vision encoder with stepwise copruning within the llm based on its hierarchical characteristics to efficiently preserve critical and informationally diverse visual tokens meanwhile to ensure compatibility with acceleration techniques like flashattention we introduce the l2 norm of kvectors as the token saliency metric in the llm extensive experiments on various large visionlanguage models demonstrate that vitcop not only achieves stateoftheart performance surpassing existing methods on both image and video understanding tasks but also significantly reduces model inference latency and gpu memory consumption notably its performance advantage over other methods becomes even more pronounced under extreme pruning rates",

         "large visionlanguage models lvlms incur high computational costs due to significant redundancy in their visual tokens to effectively reduce this cost researchers have proposed various visual token pruning methods however existing methods are generally limited either losing critical visual information prematurely due to pruning in the vision encoder or leading to information redundancy among the selected tokens due to pruning in the large language models llms to address these challenges we propose a visual and textual semantic collaborative pruning framework vitcop that combines redundancy filtering in the vision encoder with stepwise copruning within the llm based on its hierarchical characteristics to efficiently preserve critical and informationally diverse visual tokens meanwhile to ensure compatibility with acceleration techniques like flashattention we introduce the l2 norm of kvectors as the token saliency metric in the llm extensive experiments on various large visionlanguage models demonstrate that vitcop not only achieves stateoftheart performance surpassing existing methods on both image and video understanding tasks but also significantly reduces model inference latency and gpu memory consumption notably its performance advantage over other methods becomes even more pronounced under extreme pruning rates",

         "as llms are increasingly integrated into clinical workflows their tendency for sycophancy prioritizing user agreement over factual accuracy poses significant risks to patient safety while existing evaluations often rely on subjective datasets we introduce a robust framework grounded in medical mcqa with verifiable ground truths we propose the adjusted sycophancy score a novel metric that isolates alignment bias by accounting for stochastic model instability or confusability through an extensive scaling analysis of the qwen3 and llama3 families we identify a clear scaling trajectory for resilience furthermore we reveal a counterintuitive vulnerability in reasoningoptimized thinking models while they demonstrate high vanilla accuracy their internal reasoning traces frequently rationalize incorrect user suggestions under authoritative pressure our results across frontier models suggest that benchmark performance is not a proxy for clinical reliability and that simplified reasoning structures may offer superior robustness against expertdriven sycophancy",

         "data videos have become a prominent vessel for communicating data to broad audiences and a common object of study in information visualization many of these videos include music yet the impact of music on how people experience data videos remains largely unexplored we conducted a preregistered study into the effect of music across three dimensions persuasion engagement and emotion we showed online participants an existing data video 1 without any music 2 with its generic default music and 3 with custom music designed by a professional composer we found that the default music helped make the data video more persuasive however the effects of custom music were more mixed and we did not find that music increased engagement in addition and contrary to our expectations our participants reported more intense emotions without music our study contributes new insights into the intersection of music and data visualization and is a first step toward guiding designers in creating impactful datadriven narratives",
